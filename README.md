# Student Loan Risk with Deep Learning

## Description

This project aims to build a deep learning model to predict the risk of student loan repayment. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features related to student loans, such as academic data, financial data, loan details, demographics, and historical loan performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies: `pandas`, `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`

## Usage

1. Prepare the data by reading the `student-loans.csv` file and splitting it into features and target variables.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Scale the features data using `StandardScaler`.
4. Create a deep neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras.
5. Compile and fit the model using the training data.
6. Evaluate the model using the testing data.
7. Save the model to a file (`student_loans.keras`).
8. Load the saved model and make predictions on the testing data.
9. Display the classification report.

## Data

The project uses the `student-loans.csv` dataset, which contains the following columns:

- Academic data (GPA, major, course load)
- Financial data (income, credit score, existing debts)
- Loan details (interest rates, terms, amounts)
- Demographics (age, location, family finances)
- Historical loan performance and default rates
- Credit ranking (target variable)

## Model

The project uses a deep neural network model with two hidden layers and a sigmoid output layer. The model is compiled with the binary cross-entropy loss function, the Adam optimizer, and the accuracy metric.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the testing data, and the loss and accuracy metrics are displayed.

## Prediction

The saved model is loaded, and predictions are made on the testing data. The predictions are saved to a DataFrame and rounded to binary results (0 or 1).

## Recommendation System

The README file also discusses the considerations for building a recommendation system for student loans, including:

1. Data needed (academic, financial, loan details, demographics, historical performance)
2. Filtering method (content-based filtering)
3. Real-world challenges (data privacy, bias, and fairness)

Data Needed: To build a student loan recommendation system, you'd need:

Academic data (GPA, major, course load)
Financial data (income, credit score, existing debts)
Loan details (interest rates, terms, amounts)
Demographics (age, location, family finances)
Historical loan performance and default rates
This data helps assess ability to repay, financial need, and default risk, enabling personalized recommendations based on academic and financial profiles.

2. Based on the data you chose to use in this recommendation system, would your model be using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or context-based filtering? Justify why the data you selected would be suitable for your choice of filtering method.

The system would use content-based filtering, as recommendations are based on each student's individual attributes like academics, finances, and demographics. This method leverages specific user characteristics.

3. Describe two real-world challenges that you would take into consideration while building a recommendation system for student loans. Explain why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system.

Data Privacy: Ensuring privacy and security of sensitive student information to prevent identity theft and violations.
Bias and Fairness: Avoiding biases that disadvantage certain student groups, promoting fairness and equal opportunities.
These challenges impact trustworthiness and ethical integrity, which are crucial for the system's acceptance and effectiveness.
